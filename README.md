2. use `$ npm start` to launch the electron development app

# todo

here's an inventory of "stuff we need to find first":

- [x] find out "music note fonts" Finale uses and get ahold of a .ttf or .otf file of one of them (I like the Jazz font)~~
- [ ] an open source alternative to garritan instruments for playback. MIDIjs seems to have a bunch of options (http://galacticmilk.com/midi-js/) - 
- [ ] setup Gulp to compile JSX files with gulp-nodemon and gulp-react
